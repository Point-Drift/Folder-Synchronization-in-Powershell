Greetings

When executing this script please add arguments in the order of sourceFolderPath replicaFolderPath logFilePath

  Example: .\Folder_Synchronization.ps1 C:\test\originFolder C:\test\replicaFolder C:\test

  The script will create replica folders and a log folder if they do not already exist but will not create a origin folder if the selected folder does not already exist
